# ðŸ“ˆ Nasdaq Scorecard Dashboard  

## Motivation  

In today's digital age, mobile trading apps have made stock trading more accessible than ever. However, this ease of access has also gamified the experience, leading many investors to focus more on short-term price movements rather than the underlying fundamentals of the companies they invest in.  

This dashboard was created to encourage a more long-term, fundamentals-driven approach to investing. By analyzing stocks from the **NASDAQ 100**, the dashboard provides a structured way to evaluate companies beyond just price action.  

## Installation

## Scoring Metrics  

To quantify key aspects of a stock's fundamentals, I developed a **scoring system** based on five core financial metrics:  

1. **Income** â€“ Derived from the stock's **dividend yield**, representing income-generating potential.  
2. **Price** â€“ Based on the **P/E ratio**, reflecting how expensive the stock is relative to earnings.  
3. **Size** â€“ Measured by **market capitalization**, indicating the company's overall valuation.  
4. **Liquidity** â€“ Assessed using **trading volume**, representing how easily the stock can be bought or sold.  
5. **Profit** â€“ Evaluated based on the company's **trailing 12-month profit**, showing overall profitability.  

By visualizing these metrics using **radar charts**, the dashboard allows investors to quickly compare stocks and make more informed, data-driven decisions.  

## Features  

- **Filter stocks by sector** to focus on industries of interest.  
- **Choose different scoring metrics** to analyze stocks from multiple perspectives.  
- **Interactive charts** to compare top NASDAQ stocks side by side.  
- **Summary statistics** for a quick snapshot of market trends.  

This tool aims to shift the focus away from speculative trading and back toward **fundamental investing**, helping investors build a portfolio with long-term sustainability in mind.
